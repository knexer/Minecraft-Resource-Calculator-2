Minecraft-Resource-Calculator-2
===============================

The second iteration of the Minecraft Resource Calculator, this time as a mod for minecraft.

## About

Crafting something in modded Minecraft can get very complicated very quickly and keeping track of what you need can be difficult. This mod helps you out by showing you a tree and a summary of all the steps you'll go through to craft whatever it is you want, or at least it'll try.

Some mods use custom crafting mechanics like Thaumcraft with its Infusion Crafting or Industrial Craft with its wire cutters so you may not be given the entire tree. This is just how it works.
